Community Gathering, which started this Thursday in Bratislava, is in full swing! And Visibility SK is a proud host of this event.

Community International is an alliance of independent agencies and has prepared a rich program for all its members. The program is full of interesting lectures.  As a part of the event was a creative brief for executive members of the agencies.

The evening part of the program was followed in a more relaxing manner. In addition to visiting the offices of the Visibility agency, there was also a tour of Bratislava by the famous red Bratislava train. During the tour we made a stop at Bratislava Castle. We ended this wild ride full of interesting views on a boat on the Danube river and had a lot of fun with great food, good music, courtesy of our own Vlado Čabák from Visibility and last but not least in a circle of great people.
