## 1. Clarity

A messy mind will result in a messy product. So always try to remove the clutter from your thinking because it will impact the end result. Throughout the design decisions you make, there are a couple of things to always keep an eye on:

- Business goals, customer's problems and functionality motivate the design. In that order;
- Never sacrifice functionality over beauty;
- It should always be self-explanatory on what to do next;
- Highlight important content through negative space, colours, fonts, and graphics, and other UI elements;
- Text is legible at every size;
- Icons are precise and sharp;
- Extras are subtle and appropriate;
- Your users should instinctively know what to do and where they are at all times;

    "The final look of anything is the by-product of the clarity (or lack of it) during its design phase. Clarity of intent will translate into clarity of result"
    — Massimo Vignelli

### 2. Actionable Interface

Now, remember this. We must always strive to design digital products that keep the current task clear and in focus. An actionable app anticipates the user’s needs by ensuring that what’s onscreen is always current and relevant. And the app becomes an extension to what a user intends to do. So for example, if a user opens your app to solve a task and you don’t give him the solution, you made poor choices” said Sarah.
She stopped for a moment and took a couple of seconds to form her thoughts and continued “You see, the whole point of what we do is to make sure that our solutions come to the right user, at the right moment, in the right context. And of course, it is a long run until we can get to that ideal state. How to get to that state? Through multiple iterations.”
